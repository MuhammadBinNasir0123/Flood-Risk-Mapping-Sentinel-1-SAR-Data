# ðŸŒŠ Flood Risk Mapping in Pakistan (2014â€“2025)

This project analyzes **flood risk across Layyah, Dadu, and Nowshera** using **Sentinel-1 SAR data**.  
The regions were selected based on **historical flood exposure** and **diverse geographic profiles**, making them critical areas for resilience planning.  

## ðŸ“Œ Project Highlights
- **Data Source:** Sentinel-1 SAR imagery  
- **Regions Analyzed:** Layyah, Dadu, Nowshera  
- **Approach:**  
  - 2022 flood mapping to capture the impact of the July floods  
  - Change detection analysis (2014â€“2025) to track long-term inundation trends  
- **Techniques Used:** Geospatial analysis, flood change detection, and vulnerability assessment  
- **Outcome:** Actionable insights supporting **early warning systems** and **disaster resilience planning**  

## ðŸ“Š Key Insights
- Identified **high-risk flood zones** with recurrent inundation patterns  
- Highlighted regional variations in **urbanâ€“rural vulnerability**  
- Supported data-driven strategies for **mitigation and preparedness**  

## ðŸš€ Why This Matters
Flooding remains one of the most pressing climate risks for Pakistan.  
By combining **remote sensing** with **temporal change detection**, this project demonstrates how geospatial analytics can guide smarter **disaster management policies**.
